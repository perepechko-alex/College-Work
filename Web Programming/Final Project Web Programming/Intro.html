<center><h2>Instructions, please read!</h2></center>
<p>In this experiment, an audio track will play when the page loads. The track will loop continuously. There will be images and/or radio buttons on every page. The goal is for the listener to choose the image which they identify the sound with. The listener is to select one of the options presented in the buttons, and/or describe it in the textbox -- an area for the listener to write down any other comments is also presented on every page, and the user is encouraged to describe the sound to the best of their abilities. There is <strong>no right or wrong answer</strong>.</p> 

<p>Note: The "submit" button will not activate until 10 seconds have passed. Please take the time to listen to the audio carefully and thoroughly.</p>

<p>Below is the audio interface which will be used throughout the experiment. The listener has the ability to pause and play the sound, and can also select a specific instance of the sound out of its total length.</p>
